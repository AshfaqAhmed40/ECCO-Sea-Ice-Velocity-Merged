# ECCO-Sea-Ice-Velocity-Merged
This repository contains the daily sea ice mean velocity from ECCO v4r4 reanalysis run. The main action items are a) comparing the daily velocity mean with the IABP buoy calibrated NSIDC polar pathfinder daily displacement dataset and b) comparison against the ERA Interim wind daily mean velocity field.
